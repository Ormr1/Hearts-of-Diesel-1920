 POL_home_of_the_enlightenment:0 "Home of the Enlightenment"
 POL_home_of_the_enlightenment_desc:0 "Polania was the nation that most championed the ideals of the Enlightenment in Europe. It's constitution was the first of Europe and the rights it granted are second to none on the continent. Liberty flows through the people of Polania and keeping that spirit quenched will be extraordinarily difficult."
 POL_sanation_government:0 "Sanation Government"
 POL_sanation_government_desc:0 "Following the end of the Great War, Polania was in chaos. Though it had withstood the Saxon assaults from the west, the Rusviet tide from the east was unbearably fierce. Polania's armies were forced extremely far back, save for a single salient that was staunchly held until the armistice went into effect. The following Treaty of Brest-Litovsk allowed the Rusviets free military passage through Polania and caused a massive uproar among the populace of Polania. To them, allowing the Rusviets free passage through their lands was the same as annexation and subjugation though the Polanian government insisted otherwise. In the wake of the mass protests that erupted across the country, threatening to tear it apart, the Polanian marshal Józef Piłsudski led a coup against the government and established a so-called "Sanationist Government" to restore order to Polania and to "heal the political system.""
 POL_kościuszkos_legacy:0 "Kościuszko's Legacy"
 POL_kościuszkos_legacy_desc:0 "No man has had as large of an impact on history as Tadeusz Kościuszko. In the wake of the Polanian Revolution, which saw the nobility of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth adopt ideas of the Enlightenment and also bring about sweeping democratic reforms to the Commonwealth along with a drive to merge the cultures of Polish and Lithuanian into Polanian, the monarchies neighboring the Commonwealth became concerned for their own positions as their citizens had begun to demand the same reforms as the Polish-Lithuanians, now the Polanians. The surrounding monarchies formed a coalition led by the Rusviets and launched a surprise attack on the Polanians. The Polanians were caught completely off-guard and the leadership was unable to flee Kraków before a Saxo-Magyar force entered the city and captured them. In the chaos of the city's fall, the leadership was executed by the Magyars leaving Polania leaderless. Tadeusz Kościuszko, stationed in Warsaw, took up the reigns and notified all of the Polanian provinces that he had assembled a new cabinet in Warsaw and would continue the fight. With his military skill, Kościuszko was able to push the coalition out of Polania and even move into Magyaria, Saxony, and Rusviet, forcing them into a peace that preserved the former borders. After the war, Kościuszko's cabinet suggested that he become the Emperor of Polania in order to maintain order while the country recovers. After putting it to a vote, Kościuszko became the official head of the new Polanian Empire. As emperor, he ran the country as an "enlightened dictator" who tried to unify the country through new laws and a new legal code known as the Kościuszko Code. Throughout this time, he fought off multiple small coalitions trying to dethrone him from the east, west, and some within Polania. With each conquest, he spread the ideas of pan-nationalism and the Enlightenment. Unfortunately for him, his emperorship would end when the Rusviets managed to organize a larger and more prepared coalition that pushed him and his forces back, causing Polania to lose just under half of its territory in a bloody and crushing defeat. He resigned his emperorship out of shame and his final decree was to reorganize Polania as a Republic.\n\nHis reign has long since ended but his influence still holds sway in the minds of some people today. Polanian nationalists wish that the days of Polanian glory and conquest could be re-imagined in the present and the less hawkish want a stable imperial government to make Polania strong again so they may never experience a defeat like the Great War."
 POL_russophobia:0 "Russophobia"
 POL_russophobia_desc:0 "For the past few centuries, Rusviet has been Polania's greatest enemy. It has had an unrelenting thirst for Polanian blood and soil and has been the one enemy that Polania has always had the hardest time overcoming. The animosity between Polania and Rusviet has created an atmosphere in Polania of outright hatred for all things Rusviet, especially its army. Negotiations between the two will be nearly impossible and Polanians will do everything they can to ensure that Rusviet never carves up Polanian territory again."
