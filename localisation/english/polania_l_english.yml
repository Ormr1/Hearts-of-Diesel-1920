### FACTION NAMES
 
### IDEAS
 POL_home_of_the_enlightenment:0 "Home of the Enlightenment"
 POL_home_of_the_enlightenment_desc:0 "Polania was the nation that most championed the ideals of the Enlightenment in Europe. Its constitution was the first of Europe and the rights it granted are second to none on the continent. Liberty flows through the people of Polania and keeping that spirit quenched will be extraordinarily difficult."
 POL_sanation_government:0 "Sanation Government"
 POL_sanation_government_desc:0 "Following the end of the Great War, Polania was in chaos. Though it had withstood the Saxon assaults from the west, the Rusviet tide from the east was unbearably fierce. Polania's armies were forced extremely far back, save for a single salient that was staunchly held until the armistice went into effect. The following Treaty of Brest-Litovsk allowed the Rusviets free military passage through Polania and caused a massive uproar among the populace of Polania. To them, allowing the Rusviets free passage through their lands was the same as annexation and subjugation though the Polanian government insisted otherwise. In the wake of the mass protests that erupted across the country, threatening to tear it apart, the Polanian marshal Józef Piłsudski led a coup against the government and established a so-called "Sanationist Government" to restore order to Polania and to "heal the political system.""
 POL_weak_executive:0 "Weak Executive"
 POL_weak_executive_desc:0 "The constitution of the Republic places lots of government power in the hands of the Sejm, making the role of the presidency almost irrelevant. Unfortunately, this has been done in a way that means any gridlock in the Sejm leaves the government almost completely incapable of handling crises and making quick decisions when necessary."
 POL_kosciuszkos_legacy:0 "Kościuszko's Legacy"
 POL_kosciuszkos_legacy_desc:0 "No man has had as large of an impact on history as Tadeusz Kościuszko. In the wars that followed the Polanian Revolution, his military skill protected Polania from bloodthirsty neighbors. In Polania’s greatest time of need, he became the emperor of the Polanian Empire and was able to keep the country afloat and fight numerous enemies until a massive coalition crushed his armies, leading to the country losing just under half of its territory and his resignation as emperor after he made his final decree for Polania to become a republic.\n\nHis reign has long since ended but his influence still holds sway in the minds of some people today. Polanian nationalists wish that the days of Polanian glory and conquest could be re-imagined in the present and the less hawkish want a stable imperial government to make Polania strong again so they may never experience a defeat like the Great War."
 POL_russophobia:0 "Russophobia"
 POL_russophobia_desc:0 "For the past few centuries, Rusviet has been Polania's greatest enemy. It has had an unrelenting thirst for Polanian blood and soil and has been the one enemy that Polania has always had the hardest time overcoming. The animosity between Polania and Rusviet has created an atmosphere in Polania of outright hatred for all things Rusviet, especially its army. Negotiations between the two will be nearly impossible and Polanians will do everything they can to ensure that Rusviet never carves up Polanian territory again."

### NATIONAL FOCUS
 POL_stabilizing_the_country:0 "Stabilizing The Country"
 POL_stabilizing_the_country_desc:0 "The years after the Great War have been tumultuous for the Polanian Republic. The years after the war's end saw thousands of unemployed veterans left without a job but armed and trained to fight forming militias to find work with private groups, including nationalist militias fighting for self-determination for ethnic minorities in Polania who have, for a long time, been ignored by the government at best and actively oppressed at worst. This combined with massive economic downturn has led to a massive instability issue facing the Republic."
 POL_disarm_radical_militias:0 "Disarming Radical Militias"
 POL_disarm_radical_militias_desc:0 "The first and foremost issue that we need to address is the presence of violent anti-government militias spread out throughout the country. The government is going to have a hard time rolling out economic relief with the threat of government employees being assassinated by militias."
 POL_increase_danzig_garrison:0 "Increase Danzig Garrison"
 POL_increase_danzig_garrison_desc:0 "The status of the city of Danzig was reached as a compromise to soften the political blow of Saxony's treaty with Polania at the end of the Great War. However, now, the city has become a center of operations for pro-Saxon nationalist militias operating on the western provinces of Polania. We need to move more troops into Danzig and assert our government's legal and just authority over the city."
 POL_1922_elections:0 "The 1922 Elections"
 POL_1922_elections_desc:0 "The long-awaited elections of 1922 are finally upon us. The people of Polania will now decide which party running for office has the best plan to lift Polania out of its current economic crisis."

 POL_social_democrats_win_desc:0 "The Social Democrats have successfully won the Polanian elections of 1922."
 POL_draft_a_democratic_constitution:0 "Draft A Democratic Constitution"
 POL_draft_a_democratic_constitution_desc:0 "The April Constitution granted far too many powers to the executive branch of Polania, to the point of making the President effectively an autocrat. Polania needs to return to its democratic roots and establish a proper democratic constitution that restores civil liberties and brings power back to the legislature."
 POL_strengthen_the_sejm:0 "Strengthen The Sejm"
 POL_strengthen_the_sejm_desc:0 "The Sejm, Polania's legislature, had its power gutted by the April Constitution in order to "allow the Polanian political system to heal" after the instability that broke out after the Great War. Now with a new constitution, the Sejm must assert its authority and ability to carry out its duties."
 POL_codify_checks_and_balances:0 "Codify Checks And Balances"
 POL_codify_checks_and_balances_desc:0 "The President was granted many privileges from the April Constitution, among those the stripping of powers from the Sejm to hold the Executive branch accountable for misconduct. The Sejm must regain this power in order to reign in the Executive and prevent Presidential abuses of the law."
 POL_secure_independent_judiciary:0 "Secure Independent Judiciary"
 POL_secure_independent_judiciary_desc:0 "During the previous Constitution, the President notoriously hired and appointed people to the Polanian Supreme Court based on their loyalty to him. The Polanian Supreme Court must be re-balanced to be one dedicated to a strong Polanian democracy. Either by purging the court and replacing them with new members or appointing new members to balance out the "Old Guard.""
 POL_rebirth_of_the_enlightenment:0 "Rebirth Of The Enlightenment"
 POL_rebirth_of_the_enlightenment_desc:0 "Polania is considered the home of the Enlightenment. The Polanian Revolution famously led to the first constitutional Republic to be founded in the entire European continent. Just like in recent years, this revolutionary republic was hijacked by an ambitious authoritarian who twisted the laws of the Republic to suit his desire for power. Our election and success is a restoration of our democratic revolutionary spirit and a rebirth of our Enlightenment ideals."
 POL_begin_agrarian_reform:0 "Begin Agrarian Reform"
 POL_begin_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "The largest part of our party's election platform was agrarian reform in the country to be more favorable to the hard working and underpaid farmers of the countryside. Many of them work under harsh conditions on massive privately-owned farms. We will redistribute some of this land to the peasants who work on it with monetary compensation for the landowners."
 POL_subsidize_farmers:0 "Subsidize Farmers"
 POL_subsidize_farmers_desc:0 "Polania's suite of new farmers will need time and money to lift themselves onto their feet so they can be self-sufficient. Direct subsidies to these farmers will be able to give them the boost they need to remain competitive on a regional level."
 POL_break_up_agricultural_monopolies:0 "Break Up Agricultural Monopolies"'
 POL_break_up_agricultural_monopolies_desc:0 "In order to further strengthen the economic power of the common man, we need to break up these large agricultural trusts that operate most of the farms in the country. There may be a temporary loss of productivity and employment as new farms work to fill the gaps, long-term economic reforms will create a stronger and more equal economy in the long run."
 POL_tariff_foreign_grain_imports:0 "Tariff Foreign Grain Imports"
 POL_tariff_foreign_grain_imports_desc:0 "Breaking up these massive agricultural trusts will result in our agricultural industry being more vulnerable to foreign competition. We need to place tariffs on foreign grain imports to ensure that Polania's domestic industry will have time to build itself up to be internationally competitive."
 POL_local_farm_collectives:0 "Local Farm Collectives"
 POL_local_farm_collectives_desc:0 "To prevent a re-monopolization of the agricultural industry by greedy individuals, we will directly support and subsidize farms who operate as collectives, ones that are collectively run by the workers on the farm rather than a single individual."
 POL_agricultural_adjustment:0 "Agricultural Adjustment"
 POL_agricultural_adjustment_desc:0 "We don't want our farmers to be afraid of overproducing food. We need them to be as productive as possible. To prevent any worries about farming too much, we will purchase surpluses of agricultural products from our farmers and use the surpluses for government-backed food aid programs to ensure stable prices and a productive agriculture industry."
 POL_finish_agrarian_reform:0 "Finish Agrarian Reform"
 POL_finish_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "Our agrarian reform policies that we promised to complete are finally done. Rejoice, Polanians! A more equal Polania awaits!"

 POL_loosen_trade_regulations:0 "Loosen Trade Regulations"
 POL_loosen_trade_regulations_desc:0 "The best way to keep our industries competitive is to have them compete with international companies to keep them on their toes and maintain a high level of quality and efficiency."
 POL_invite_intellectuals_to_government:0 "Invite Intellectuals To Government"
 POL_invite_intellectuals_to_government_desc:0 "We shall invite the best and brightest minds of the Republic to run the country. After all, we want to make sure that only the best are able to control the lives of so many people."
 POL_boost_university_funding:0 "Boost University Funding"
 POL_boost_university_funding_desc:0 "In order for Polania to thrive in the new Europa, we need to supplant Saxony's status as the hub of innovation on the continent. To do so, we'll pour heavy investments into the nation's education sector to create a nation promising young minds across Europa will come to."
 POL_public_education_program:0 "Public Education Program"
 POL_public_education_program_desc:0 "The creation of public school system will ensure that no Polanian is denied the opportunity of a high quality education. To let even one bright mind fall through the cracks would be a tragedy."
