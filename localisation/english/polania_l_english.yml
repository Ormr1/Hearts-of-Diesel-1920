### FACTION NAMES
 
### IDEAS
 POL_polania_is_not_yet_lost:0 "Polania Is Not Yet Lost!"
 POL_home_of_the_enlightenment:0 "Home of the Enlightenment"
 POL_home_of_the_enlightenment_desc:0 "Polania was the nation that most championed the ideals of the Enlightenment in Europe. Its constitution was the first of Europe and the rights it granted are second to none on the continent. Liberty flows through the people of Polania and keeping that spirit quenched will be extraordinarily difficult."
 POL_sanation_government:0 "Sanation Government"
 POL_sanation_government_desc:0 "Following the end of the Great War, Polania was in chaos. Though it had withstood the Saxon assaults from the west, the Rusviet tide from the east was unbearably fierce. Polania's armies were forced extremely far back, save for a single salient that was staunchly held until the armistice went into effect. The following Treaty of Brest-Litovsk allowed the Rusviets free military passage through Polania and caused a massive uproar among the populace of Polania. To them, allowing the Rusviets free passage through their lands was the same as annexation and subjugation though the Polanian government insisted otherwise. In the wake of the mass protests that erupted across the country, threatening to tear it apart, the Polanian marshal Józef Piłsudski led a coup against the government and established a so-called "Sanationist Government" to restore order to Polania and to "heal the political system.""
 POL_weak_executive:0 "Weak Executive"
 POL_weak_executive_desc:0 "The constitution of the Republic places lots of government power in the hands of the Sejm, making the role of the presidency almost irrelevant. Unfortunately, this has been done in a way that means any gridlock in the Sejm leaves the government almost completely incapable of handling crises and making quick decisions when necessary."
 POL_kosciuszkos_legacy:0 "Kościuszko's Legacy"
 POL_kosciuszkos_legacy_desc:0 "No man has had as large of an impact on history as Tadeusz Kościuszko. In the wars that followed the Polanian Revolution, his military skill protected Polania from bloodthirsty neighbors. In Polania’s greatest time of need, he became the emperor of the Polanian Empire and was able to keep the country afloat and fight numerous enemies until a massive coalition crushed his armies, leading to the country losing just under half of its territory and his resignation as emperor after he made his final decree for Polania to become a republic.\n\nHis reign has long since ended but his influence still holds sway in the minds of some people today. Polanian nationalists wish that the days of Polanian glory and conquest could be re-imagined in the present and the less hawkish want a stable imperial government to make Polania strong again so they may never experience a defeat like the Great War."
 POL_russophobia:0 "Russophobia"
 POL_russophobia_desc:0 "For the past few centuries, Rusviet has been Polania's greatest enemy. It has had an unrelenting thirst for Polanian blood and soil and has been the one enemy that Polania has always had the hardest time overcoming. The animosity between Polania and Rusviet has created an atmosphere in Polania of outright hatred for all things Rusviet, especially its army. Negotiations between the two will be nearly impossible and Polanians will do everything they can to ensure that Rusviet never carves up Polanian territory again."

### NATIONAL FOCUS
 POL_stabilizing_the_country:0 "Stabilizing The Country"
 POL_stabilizing_the_country_desc:0 "The years after the Great War have been tumultuous for the Polanian Republic. The years after the war's end saw thousands of unemployed veterans left without a job but armed and trained to fight forming militias to find work with private groups, including nationalist militias fighting for self-determination for ethnic minorities in Polania who have, for a long time, been ignored by the government at best and actively oppressed at worst. This combined with massive economic downturn has led to a massive instability issue facing the Republic."
 POL_disarm_radical_militias:0 "Disarming Radical Militias"
 POL_disarm_radical_militias_desc:0 "The first and foremost issue that we need to address is the presence of violent anti-government militias spread out throughout the country. The government is going to have a hard time rolling out economic relief with the threat of government employees being assassinated by militias."
 POL_increase_danzig_garrison:0 "Increase Danzig Garrison"
 POL_increase_danzig_garrison_desc:0 "The status of the city of Danzig was reached as a compromise to soften the political blow of Saxony's treaty with Polania at the end of the Great War. However, now, the city has become a center of operations for pro-Saxon nationalist militias operating on the western provinces of Polania. We need to move more troops into Danzig and assert our government's legal and just authority over the city."
 POL_1922_elections:0 "The 1922 Elections"
 POL_1922_elections_desc:0 "The long-awaited elections of 1922 are finally upon us. The people of Polania will now decide which party running for office has the best plan to lift Polania out of its current economic crisis."

 POL_uplift_the_peasantry:0 "Uplift The Peasantry"
 POL_uplift_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The peasantry of eastern Polania have historically been relegated to agricultural roles with little chance of advancement in their lives. By industrializing that region and investing in the economic health of Polanian farmers, we can uplift the peasants and give them opportunities for better lives."
 POL_rural_education_initiative:0 "Rural Education Initiative"
 POL_rural_education_initiative_desc:0 "One of the issues plaguing eastern Polania is its lack of educational opportunities. By investing in eastern Polanian schools and putting an emphasis on expanding educational access to the poorest of Polanians, we'll be able to remedy this tragedy."
 POL_rights_for_women:0 "Rights For Women"
 POL_rights_for_women_desc:0 "To the west, in Usonia, women are granted the same legal and political rights as men. Contrary to the fears of conservatives, this hasn't led to the destruction of families nor the total degradation of society. In fact, it's allowed for more people to contribute to the bettering of the nation. Just as the constitutional republic of the West has benefitted from this, so too shall the constitutional republic of the East."
 POL_compensated_collectivization:0 "Compensated Collectivization"
 POL_compensated_collectivization_desc:0 "Compensation to landowners for collectivization policies on farms will reduce the risk of them trying to stage some sort of coup or undermine our authority in the future."
 POL_industrial_democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
 POL_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "The workers of Polania should be able to experience democracy more than just during election seasons and should be important in both politics and in work.

 POL_autonomy_for_ukraizhia:0 "Autonomy For Ukraizhia"
 POL_autonomy_for_ukraizhia_desc:0 "The Ukraizhians in the south of Polania have been agitating for independence for the longest time. However, we think we've found a way to compromise with them by granting Ukraizhian provinces regional autonomy."
 POL_deport_saxons:0 "Deport Saxons"
 POL_deport_saxons_desc:0 "Saxony is the mortal enemy of Polania and Saxon nationalists in the west have been in open conflict with Polanian authorities to once again be part of Saxony. Well, they can get their wish."
 POL_arm_rusviet_ukraizhians:0 "Arm Rusviet Ukraizhians"
 POL_arm_rusviet_ukraizhians_desc:0 "After seeing the successes of the autonomous regions we've established in southern Polania, many Ukraizhians in Rusviet have grown to be more sympathetic towards Polanian rule, though many are still skeptical thanks to centuries of conflict. To show we're serious about supporting Ukraizhian self-determination, we'll send equipment to Ukraizhian anti-Rusviet groups to shore them up."

 POL_establish_ruthenian_peoples_republic_desc:0 "It's time to finally make incursions into Rusviet territory as they've done to our people so many times in the past. We won't be alone, however. We'll be assisting the Ruthenian Freedom Legion, an anti-Rusviet militia force in Novogrudok."

 POL_social_democrats_win:0 "Social Democrats Win"
 POL_social_democrats_win_desc:0 "The Social Democrats have successfully won the Polanian elections of 1922."
 POL_draft_a_democratic_constitution:0 "Draft A Democratic Constitution"
 POL_draft_a_democratic_constitution_desc:0 "The April Constitution granted far too many powers to the executive branch of Polania, to the point of making the President effectively an autocrat. Polania needs to return to its democratic roots and establish a proper democratic constitution that restores civil liberties and brings power back to the legislature."
 POL_strengthen_the_sejm:0 "Strengthen The Sejm"
 POL_strengthen_the_sejm_desc:0 "The Sejm, Polania's legislature, had its power gutted by the April Constitution in order to "allow the Polanian political system to heal" after the instability that broke out after the Great War. Now with a new constitution, the Sejm must assert its authority and ability to carry out its duties."
 POL_codify_checks_and_balances:0 "Codify Checks And Balances"
 POL_codify_checks_and_balances_desc:0 "The President was granted many privileges from the April Constitution, among those the stripping of powers from the Sejm to hold the Executive branch accountable for misconduct. The Sejm must regain this power in order to reign in the Executive and prevent Presidential abuses of the law."
 POL_secure_independent_judiciary:0 "Secure Independent Judiciary"
 POL_secure_independent_judiciary_desc:0 "During the previous Constitution, the President notoriously hired and appointed people to the Polanian Supreme Court based on their loyalty to him. The Polanian Supreme Court must be re-balanced to be one dedicated to a strong Polanian democracy. Either by purging the court and replacing them with new members or appointing new members to balance out the "Old Guard.""
 POL_rebirth_of_the_enlightenment:0 "Rebirth Of The Enlightenment"
 POL_rebirth_of_the_enlightenment_desc:0 "Polania is considered the home of the Enlightenment. The Polanian Revolution famously led to the first constitutional Republic to be founded in the entire European continent. Just like in recent years, this revolutionary republic was hijacked by an ambitious authoritarian who twisted the laws of the Republic to suit his desire for power. Our election and success is a restoration of our democratic revolutionary spirit and a rebirth of our Enlightenment ideals."
 POL_begin_agrarian_reform:0 "Begin Agrarian Reform"
 POL_begin_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "The largest part of our party's election platform was agrarian reform in the country to be more favorable to the hard working and underpaid farmers of the countryside.

 POL_subsidize_farmers:0 "Subsidize Farmers"

 POL_tariff_foreign_grain_imports:0 "Tariff Foreign Grain Imports"
 POL_tariff_foreign_grain_imports_desc:0 "Breaking up these massive agricultural trusts will result in our agricultural industry being more vulnerable to foreign competition.

 POL_agricultural_adjustment:0 "Agricultural Adjustment"
 POL_agricultural_adjustment_desc:0 "We don't want our farmers to be afraid of overproducing food. We need them to be as productive as possible.
