 POL_home_of_the_enlightenment:0 "Home of the Enlightenment"
 POL_home_of_the_enlightenment_desc:0 "Polania was the nation that most championed the ideals of the Enlightenment in Europe. It's constitution was the first of Europe and the rights it granted are second to none on the continent. Liberty flows through the people of Polania and keeping that spirit quenched will be extraordinarily difficult."
 POL_sanation_government:0 "Sanation Government"
 POL_sanation_government_desc:0 "Following the end of the Great War, Polania was in chaos. Though it had withstood the Saxon assaults from the west, the Rusviet tide from the east was unbearably fierce. Polania's armies were forced extremely far back, save for a single salient that was staunchly held until the armistice went into effect. The following Treaty of Brest-Litovsk allowed the Rusviets free military passage through Polania and caused a massive uproar among the populace of Polania. To them, allowing the Rusviets free passage through their lands was the same as annexation and subjugation though the Polanian government insisted otherwise. In the wake of the mass protests that erupted across the country, threatening to tear it apart, the Polanian marshal Józef Piłsudski led a coup against the government and established a so-called "Sanationist Government" to restore order to Polania and to "heal the political system.""
 POL_kościuszkos_legacy:0 "Kościuszko's Legacy"
 POL_kościuszkos_legacy_desc:0 "No man has had as large of an impact on history as Tadeusz Kościuszko. In the wars that followed the Polanian Revolution, his military skill protected Polania from bloodthirsty neighbors. In Polania’s greatest time of need, he became the emperor of the Polanian Empire and was able to keep the country afloat and fight numerous enemies until a massive coalition crushed his armies, leading to the country losing just under half of its territory and his resignation as emperor after he made his final decree for Polania to become a republic.\n\nHis reign has long since ended but his influence still holds sway in the minds of some people today. Polanian nationalists wish that the days of Polanian glory and conquest could be re-imagined in the present and the less hawkish want a stable imperial government to make Polania strong again so they may never experience a defeat like the Great War."
 POL_russophobia:0 "Russophobia"
 POL_russophobia_desc:0 "For the past few centuries, Rusviet has been Polania's greatest enemy. It has had an unrelenting thirst for Polanian blood and soil and has been the one enemy that Polania has always had the hardest time overcoming. The animosity between Polania and Rusviet has created an atmosphere in Polania of outright hatred for all things Rusviet, especially its army. Negotiations between the two will be nearly impossible and Polanians will do everything they can to ensure that Rusviet never carves up Polanian territory again."
