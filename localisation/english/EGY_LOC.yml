###FOCUSES ALPHA###
EGY_A1: "Echoes Of The Past"
EGY_A1_desc: "Through the halls of time, old mouths open. They breathe dust, spit dirt, stiff as the stone they were hewn from. Speaking with the wisdom of ages, they cry for their home. For retribution. For restoration. For freedom."
EGY_A2: "He Came From Albion"
EGY_A2_desc: "Our fledgling cause has found an unlikely ally. A few days ago, an esteemed professor of archaeology made contact with one of our agents, wishing to lend his support to our struggle. Seems he's gained quite the soft spot for the ancient times and wants to see them return as much as we do. \nRecruit Howard Carter."
EGY_A3: "Intelligence, Or Lack Thereof"
EGY_A3_desc: "A signal-jacker was recently arrested in Cairo while trying to break encrypted Roman diplomatic telegrams, and is languishing in the city jail. His work can't be faulted, but his common sense leaves a lot to be desired: he left the door open while he was doing it and his landlady overheard him and ratted him out. Freeing him from his cell and recruiting him will be a boon to us and an effective two-finger salute to the Romans who put him there. \nRecruit Imhotep Astari."
EGY_A4: "An Offer You Can't Refuse"
EGY_A4_desc: "Carter believes he can convince one of his former associates from the institute to aid us in our cause, but the man wants to be sure we're the real deal. \nMake contact with The Broker and convince him we're legit."
EGY_A5: "The Producer"
EGY_A5_desc: "Cleopatra's time in hollywood has put her in contact with a lot of men who can turn logistical nightmares into cakewalks. One of these men is Herbert Alvis, a big-shot Hollywood producer who has hit a losing streak after backing the wrong horse. Apparently 'French Mistake' is slang for something else and not suitable for film title. Regardless of his taste in creative direction, he's impressively skilled at getting things organised and schmoozing rich people out of their money. \nRecruit Herbert Alvis."
EGY_A6: "Secure The Keys"
EGY_A6_desc: "In order to effectively challenge the occupying forces as equals, we need to be prepared. We need guns, money, and information, so seek them out."
EGY_A7: "For The Taking"
EGY_A7_desc: "It seems Roman operational security is quite lax. We have received word that an arms shipment is heading down the nile headed for the garrison troops at Thebes. Now, I don't know about you, but I think those guns would be better used by us. If we create a jam in the river in the middle of nowhere, we can hijack the shipment and grab it for ourselves miles away from Roman support."
EGY_A8: "Wrong Number"
EGY_A8_desc: "Thanks to some crossed wires, Imhotep has clued us into a rather juicy piece of gossip. Apparently, a senior Roman official in Alexandria is at risk of having his affair exposed unless he pays his mistress off to the tune of 5,000 solidus. Not wanting to cause a fuss, the powers that be in Constantinople are wiring him the money in a secure wireless transfer to keep things hush-hush. If we intercept the banking draft before it reaches him, we can pocket the change for our own ends and expose a selacious affair, undermining Roman reputations."
EGY_A9: "The Man On The Inside"
EGY_A9_desc: "A city councillor in Thebes has been campaigning for change in municipal policies for quite a while now, but has been getting nowhere as he's been blocked by the tetrachy at every turn, and they've set a whopping ambush for him in the next municipal election in the form of a nasty smear campaign. If we help him win the upcoming election, he says he'll be happy to pass on any information he gets to us and aid our troops in the struggle. Snub that smear, and put the fear of Osiris into his opponents."
EGY_A10: "Cheap And Simple"
EGY_A10_desc: "Making weapons cheaply and robustly is the key to winning, and we're going to need to evaluate designs. This seems like the perfect opportunity to hold an underground arms trial, with all the big anarchist names competing to get the contract."
EGY_A11: "Ascend From Darkness"
EGY_A11_desc: "Now we have prepared a small but dedicated force of guerillas, it is time to introduce ourselves to the opposition. Think of is as a friendly hello, that comes in the form of a fist from the shadows."
EGY_A12: "The Fight"
EGY_A12_desc: ""
EGY_A13: "Extra Extra"
EGY_A13_desc: "The Romans are eager to try and keep a lid on this whole thing. While they can’t solicit any foreign support this way, neither can we, and it certainly makes it harder to introduce our cause to the people. The Editorial staff of the Alexandrian Gazette are expected to meet with the Tetrarch’s staff later this week so the Romans can tell what they can and can’t print, and none of them are happy about it. I’m sure they’ll thank us if that meeting never happens."
EGY_A14: "Room Service"
EGY_A14_desc: "The Palm Plaza hotel in Cairo is a star in it’s own right. Every year, hundreds of the world’s elite flock there for their vacations. Movie stars, singers, diplomats, politicians, it’s a veritable who’s who in the lobby I swear. If we can set up a system of hidden microphones and recruit the staff , then we will be able to accrue enough blackmail material to last us a lifetime. Pharaoh Cleopatra’s Hollywood alter-ego might be useful for this."
EGY_A15: "Block-Busted"
EGY_A15_desc: "Marcus Lucius is known all over the world as a dashing silver-screen heart-throb, but we see him as a dastardly cad. As we speak, he has been cast by Bassileus Pictures as the lead in their new production of Anthony and Cleopatra. Obviously, being made by Romans with the need for propaganda, the script has had a few light historical changes. And by that we mean it’s a revisionist white-washing piece of trash, and what’s worse is that the bloody thing is being filmed in the temple of Ptah, in Memphis. Needless to say Mr Carter is incandescent with historical rage. Kidnap Lucius from the set and make sure that film dies on the cutting room floor."
EGY_A16: "Rain Fire"
EGY_A16_desc: "Our introduction seems to have made exactly the impression we wanted it to. As we speak, the Romans are taking measures to stop us. We should demonstrate that it is them who will be confounded, not us."
EGY_A17: "Fishrot"
EGY_A17_desc: "The Romans have managed to get some fun new toys for their security services to play with. Our watchers on the docks have noticed that the number of fishing boats in the Alexadrian bay and the Nile delta have tripled in the last month. Either the tetrachy is planning the mother of all seafood and sushi nights, or something is afoot. We believe that these boats are part of a cutting-edge network of hydrophones and signals monitoring systems intended to curb our arms shipments coming from Albion by sea. If this continues, the smugglers will balk and we'll have to bring them round the horn of Africa, majorly delaying delivery dates. Luckily, we have a solution: if we feed transponders wrapped in fish to the local dolphin population, we can effectively drown out any useful intelligence in a literal sea of white noise, turning their multi-million solidus surveillance system into a very expensive paperweight."
EGY_A18: "Bad Publicity"
EGY_A18_desc: ""
EGY_A19: "False Profits"
EGY_A19_desc: "A Byzantine consortium has slowly and with the tacit approval of the Tetrarchy been buying up resources production in Kemet, such as mines and food production. A fraction these products are returned to the people and when they are they're sold for high price, which would make the nile Byzantium's personal breadbasket. We would sabotage their flow of money, but nobody has figured out how they own 75% of this land's resources and still manage to make a loss. Until now. We believe that these profits are being siphoned back to Constantinople through the new cathedral in Alexandria, paid in as donations and then sent back to the head offices. Because it's religious money, it can't be taxed or levied, keeping it remarkably secure in transit. If we were to expose this, the Tetrarch would look like a fool and the combined scandal would be enough to drop their stock price through the floor."
EGY_A20: "It's The Pits"
EGY_A20_desc: "Now we have the people's attention, we should focus on winning hearts and minds here and abroad."
EGY_A21: "Unleash The Hoarde"
EGY_A21_desc: ""
EGY_A22: "The Good Doctor"
EGY_A22_desc: "At 2300 hours last night, we received an encoded transmission from Western Rome of all places. Turns out, one of Tesla's former scientists, who was forcibly recruited in the last war by the Romans, has had a change of heart and would like to offer us his services. Not that he needed much of a push, the nature of his recruitment was interesting to say the least. Having one of Tesla's all-stars on the team will be a significant technical advantage, and he is also promising current Roman research and diplomat cheques to the sum of 4,000 deben, recently lifted from the imperial treasury. The only problem is getting him out of there."
EGY_A23: "PSA"
EGY_A23_desc: "In a few weeks time, the Roman National Broadcasting Corporation is unveiling it's fancy new Aegyptus Local Network, allowing them to keep control of the narrative and a lid on the propaganda situation. We think that the people of Kemet would rather hear the voice of their Pharoah rallying them to fight for their heritage, history, and homeland. And with the brief window after switch-on when the repeaters are out of sync, we can hijack this network permanently and use it to our benefit."
EGY_A24: "Second Helpings"
EGY_A24_desc: "As things have rapidly gone tits-up, the Tetrarchy is trying to literally starve us and our supporters of supplies. Using the recent poor harvests in Anatolia as an excuse, they have instituted a new rationing system and have begun to co-opt food supplies for their own purposes. What isn't being tols is that the number and type of ration stamps you get depends on your job, where you live, and how loyal you are to the reigime of the day. If we raid the office of supply and currency, we can grab the printing plates being used and create perfect counterfeits of the ration books, distributing them to whoever we want to and permanently devaluing the system."
EGY_A25: "The Man From Pompeii"
EGY_A25_desc: "Neith weaves good fortune today. We have found out about a hand-over between Western Rome and the Byzantines taking place in the Alexandrian harbour. It seems that a Byzantine agent was picked up in Rome recently, and the powers that be have been negotiating to trade him for the elusive Man From Pompeii, a near-mythical spy that the Byzantines snagged by pure luck. If we interfere, we can make sure that Rome gets their boy back while the Byzantines get stiffed, handing the West their most valuable asset and breeding mutual distrust between the two nations."
EGY_A26: "Skewer The Winged Beast"
EGY_A26_desc: "Alarmingly, it seems that trouble is brewing over the Suez. As it would happen, the minority Muslim population in the area is being armed and radicalised by an outside party, we suspect the Saxons. Weaken this "Brotherhood" before it can even begin."
EGY_A27: "Denial"
EGY_A27_desc: "Whoever's backing the Muslims has inordinate amounts of global clout. They have recently arranged for the release of a radical scholar and preacher from Hispanian jail in order to rally them into a religious fervor. Of course, this man relies on his integrity to be convincing, so let's compromise that. Set him up in a hotel room with a hooker, two bottles of Irish Spirit, and a lot of Columbian marching powder, take a few photos, make some glossy 8x10s, and then send them global via the press, and it should critically injure his reputation enough for his people to reject him entirely."
EGY_A28: "Mine's A Big One"
EGY_A28_desc: "It's just as we feared: those sausage-scoffing blowhards in Saxony are funding the Muslim Brotherhood and supplying them with arms. They're doing it through the Trans-Aegean Shipping Corporation, a front for their smuggling but nonetheless effective. However, we have a plan to deal with this. If we fill oil-barrels with explosives and a contact fuse supplied by our friends in Albion, then we can make rudimentary sea mines. Chain those together and string them in front of the approaching ships from smaller boats, and we can scupper several very expensive shipments before they get wise."
EGY_A29: "De Pleur"
EGY_A29_desc: "Alarmingly, Jean 'De Pleur' Michel has been spotted by our agents in Suez, with the assumption that he is going to train Muslim troops in desert tactics that will be invaluable in their fight against us. De Pleur is very bad news. A Francian expert in desert warfare, he knows our terrain quite well, and his knowledge will remove any home advantage we ever had. Kidnap him, and make him see our way of thinking. Failing that, kill him."
EGY_A30: "Pulling The Rug"
EGY_A30_desc: "Seems like the Kaiser is doing a little bit of home decorating, and has gained an appreciation for the orient. He is willing to part with a sizable chunk of change in return for a priceless persian rug, which has fallen into the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine and Arabia. Assuredly, that chunk of change will be spent on weapons to fight us with, and we can't have that. The Kaiser is sending an appraiser to verify it's authenticity, and we have acquired with Mr Carter's expertise a very realistic looking fake that only a trained eye would be able to discern. Swap the rug for the fake, and it will certainly sour things between the Muslims and their benefactors, and we'll have a nice new rug for a museum. Or the Pharoah Cave."
EGY_A31: "Wield A Fist Of Iron"
EGY_A31_desc: "With our sights set firmly on Cairo, we will need some heavier equipment and greater forces before the final push. With the people rallied to the cry, recruitment isn't hard, but we'll need some showstopping new toys."
EGY_A32: "Prototype"
EGY_A32_desc: "The Eastern Roman empire has either developed or appropriated some cutting-edge mech technology, and are going to be testing it in the coming weeks. The 'Varangian' Assault Mech is their new fort-breaker model, designed with the sole purpose of assailing fortifications. And they're going to test it out by destroying the ruins of the great temple of bast at Karnakh. Other than this being a horrific afront to our gods, it is a direct assault on the patron goddess of the Pharoah Cleopatra, almost certainly intentional for propaganda purposes. We'd rather this didn't happen, and once in our hands the mech will be invaluable. Hijack the prototype, turn it loose on it's creators, and then return it to us."
EGY_A33: "Foreign Toys"
EGY_A33_desc: ""
EGY_A34: "The Motherlode"
EGY_A34_desc: "Imhotep's control of the local Roman broadcast network has already gotten results, in the form of some juicy new gossip that will soon be swimming it's way up the Red Sea. This is the big one, boys and girls, forget the big kahuna this kahuna is positively monumental in size. We estimate that this is the single largest covert arms shipment ever sent in the history of cloak-and-dagger. Destined for Arabia through the red sea, while disguised as a shipment of tractors, oil drilling equipment, and canned goods, it has a private security detail that rivals most Army Groups. Taking it will be no easy feat, but the commandos in the Sobek Battalion believe they have a plan..."
EGY_A35: "Decapitation"
EGY_A35_desc: "Things are swinging towards a nice strong crescendo, and if everything has gone to plan so far, we'll be ready to deliver the coup de grace. We need something big. Something bold. A real all-singing, all-dancing, showstopper of a performance to seal the deal. Even through all of this the Tetrarch has managed to keep his head. Let's change that. \n[IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'VE MISSED, NOW'S THE TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE THINGS GET REALLY WACKY FROM HERE ON OUT]"
EGY_A36: "Raise Hell"
EGY_A36_desc: "When we killed the Tetrarch, we effectively blew the starting whistle on a multi-faction rebellion free-for-all. No sooner than his corpse hit the floor, but the Muslims came crawling out of the suez aswell."
EGY_A37: "Vengeance"
EGY_A37_desc: "Abdul Al-Assid Said has been an evil little thorn in our side for too long, and his actions demand swift and mortifying retribution. The head of the Muslim Brotherhood's ersatz secret police-cum-intelligence service, he is responsible for the murder of some of our most loyal comrades, as well as the torture and execution of innocent civilians whose crimes range from aiding our cause to looking at him funny. This cannot and will not stand. The verdict is death, and the best way to go about it would be to cut him from anus to armpit and leave him gutted on the altar of sekhmet. I'm sure the goddess of war will appreciate the gift of her enemy's head on a silver platter."
EGY_A38: "The Colossus"
EGY_A38_desc: "Seems Doctor Meridius and the Varangian prototype mech are a match written in the stars. No sooner had we introduced the two of them, the good doctor had already laid bare the machines secrets for all to see, and has drawn up plans for a super-mech of our own. This is highly fortuitous, as concerning transmissions from Constantinople have suggested that they're planning on deploying a Centurion to aid in the defense of the administrative capital. For the uninitiated in the room, a Centurion is 50ft of steel and malice, used primarily to scare the enemy into surrendering. However, Doctor Meridius says he'll have an answer to that at the appropriate time, he just needs the parts."
EGY_A39: "Consul"
EGY_A39_desc: "With the Tetrarch disposed of, the Romans have stepped up their response to a full military engagement, and they're sending a military consul to take control of the situation. Legate Maximillian Horatius is the man best known for giving Western Rome a few very nasty kickings in their last war, and has been brought out of his retirement, which is bad news for us as his healthy measure of suspicion has made him nigh-untouchable in the past. Almost impossible to manipulate or assassinate, Roman resistance will be much stiffer with him in command. However, we have found a weak link close to the top of his chain of command: one of his lieutenants is a spy for Western Rome. If we reveal to him that his administration has been compromised and frame a few others, we can let his paranoia do the rest and the resulting witch-hunt will decimate the local officer's corps"
EGY_A40: "Damnation"
EGY_A40_desc: "The world weather office is predicting record rainfall this Akhet, meaning that the Nile will flood it's banks more than previously expected. The Romans are prepared for this, however, and have set up several lines of flood defenses around the capital and other vital areas. If we were to sabotage these, then these key areas would flood, hampering troop movement and causing mass electrical failure. Amphibious movement is our forte, and most of our troops have been paddling in flooded water most of their lives, so it gives us a distinct home advantage. What's more, one of our more bloody-minded commanders has had a brilliant if slightly evil idea: Force the Romans off structures and into the water with condensed artillery fire, then drop two cables connected to many large generators into the water, and you will effectively have turned downtown Cairo into a giant bug-zapper. The Municipal Power Plant 10Km outside the city limits should do the trick."
EGY_A41: "Freedom"
EGY_A41_desc: "'Step 9, Carter, Freedom!' \n'For you, Cleo! Not for me!' \n'CARTER!!!' "
EGY_A42: "The Final Push"
EGY_A42_desc: "Despite the cause of holding on to their 'Aegyptus' being a lost one, the forces of Byzantium are going to give us one final show of strength. They have amassed 70% of their southern army groups and are heading towards Suez at a breakneck pace. How they convinced the Saxons to let them walk through the levant is beyond us, but it may be the work of whoever had them backing those Muslims. No matter, the only concern now is the hoarde of angry Romans heading towards us."

EGY_Z.1.t: "A Postcard From Thebes"
EGY_Z.1.d: "July 1969, Polypicture Studios, Hollywood \nHerb Alvis' Office \nAh...Thebes. He hadn't been there in years. LA is hot, but the banks of the nile it ain't. As requested, he'd had the personal effects of one Howard Carter dug out of the archives. It was for this new 'Goddess Of The Nile' biopic. The studio was pulling out all the stops, and the star power was growing by the day, so they wanted accuracy and they'd pay to get it. Unfortunately, the authorities wouldn't let the package leave the country, so someone would have to go and get it in person. Lorelai will do fine. Might get her out of the bullpen. \nAlvis remembered the theme but not the details. Kemet in the 20's was a technicolour mess in a 40 degree heat. There was Cleo. Of course there was Cleo. And the bald one, who was...? And those jackass brothers, with the big santa-clause beards. And the one upstart from the south..."
