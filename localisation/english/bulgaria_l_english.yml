 BUL_prussia_of_the_balkans_01:0 "Saxony of the Balkans"
 BUL_prussia_of_the_balkans_01_desc:0 "During its early years, the Tsardom of Bulgaria was a heavily militarized state with a large and well-equipped army, identified as Saxony of the Balkans, the later-founded Bulgarian Empire would rise to have almost total military dominance of the Balkans with its heavily militarized society and professionalized and well-equipped armed forces."
 BUL_master_of_the_balkans:0 "Master of the Balkans"
 BUL_master_of_the_balkans_desc:0 "Bulgaria has risen to become the master of the Balkan peninsula through military conquest and hard power. However, this dominance hasn't come without drawbacks. The security of the Bulgarian state in the past few decades, even while the Great War raged just north of it, has led to an uncomfortable level of complacency in the Bulgarian military and populace who both cling to maintenance of the status quo in the Balkans. This is a problem as Balkania and the Magyars have been positioning more aggressively on the Bulgarian borders and Tsar Boris III has been voicing desires to expand southward and eastward in order to achieve control of the strategic Bosphorus Strait and increase Bulgaria's presence in the Black Sea by taking the Crimean-controlled port of Cetatea Albă. It will be up to him to re-energize Bulgarian society."
