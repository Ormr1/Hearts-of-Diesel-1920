Yet such mockery overlooks the extraordinary esprit de corps presents across the Usonian military. Its soldiers have developed an international reputation for sheer nerve, and bravery bordering on recklessness. During the Great War, a Usonian volunteer regiment was ordered by its Frankish attache to retreat, and the response "Retreat? Hell we just got here" has become a rallying cry across the entire Usonian Army."

Though they were never intended to do so, Usonian films have become ways for people around the world to see what we Usonians have and they want it. They don't just want our material goods and wealth, they also want our political system. Our rights, freedoms, and liberties. Foreign desire for both has led to the Usonian film industry becoming a blessing for Usonian diplomats."

 USA_1920_Elections_desc:0 "The 1920 elections showcase a battle between two opposing economic systems that have been in conflict since the Revolution: that of Hamiltonian economics championed by Federalist Booker T. Washington and that of Jeffersonian economics championed by the Democratic Republican James Cox. Who will come out on top will decide the priorities of Usonia on the homefront for the start of the decade."

 USA_Support_Small_Businesses_desc:0 "The family-run businesses of Usonia have, in recent years, faced a massive uphill battle against the Robber Barons who seek to monopolize parts of the Usonian economy. These small businesses need to be directly supported by the federal government if they hope to stand a chance against the monopolists in their home areas."
 USA_Eight_Hour_Workday:0 "Eight Hour Workday"
 USA_Eight_Hour_Workday_desc:0 "An eight hour workday is long overdue in a wealthy nation like Usonia.

Building new roads between major western cities will provide a great benefit for the people living there."
 USA_Invigorate_The_Deep_South:0 "Invigorate The Deep South"
 USA_Invigorate_The_Deep_South_desc:0 "The Deep South has been mostly ignored by the near-total dominance of politics by the Northeastern-focused Federalists. We need to re-invigorate that part of the country so it can catch up with the rest."

 USA_Relief_For_Tennessee_River_Victims:0 "Relief For Tennessee River Victims"
 USA_Relief_For_Tennessee_River_Victims_desc:0 "For years, the Tennessee River has been both a blessing and a curse for the people around it. It provides beautiful scenery, fresh water, and ample amounts of fish but at the cost of it flooding constantly. The floods' damages to the surrounding area have made it one of the poorer regions of Usonia due to the lack of development opportunity. We need to start providing some levels of relief to the families living nearby so that they can economically recover quicker and rebuild their homes when floods arrive."
 USA_Reviving_The_Western_States:0 "Reviving The Western States"
