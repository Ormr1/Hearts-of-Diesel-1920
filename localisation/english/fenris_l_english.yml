 fenris.1.d:0 "Esteemed Patron and Friend of Nicola Tesla,\nI am Vesna, daughter of Nicola Tesla. I write to you requesting your help. Please understand that this is a measure of last resort. I do not wish to take advantage of the relationship you have cultivated with my father. He and I are capable and resourceful people, as I am sure you know. Even so, I have found myself in a situation from which I see no escape.\nSince closing the Factory, my father and I have been living in the secure inner hold, working on a new technology which Father hopes will be his salvation. Shortly after the New Year, a band of mercenaries managed to penetrate the hold and take us captive. They separated my father and me, but my understanding is that they wish for my father to complete the work on his latest, and most powerful mechs. My father would never do so, even if his life rested on it. But instead, it is my life they threaten. My father will not let me die. I ask for your help, not to protect myself, but my father. If I can escape this place, he can end his work on these horrific machines. I know that, other than my safety, this is his greatest wish. I do not know when I will be able to get these messages to our carrier pigeons, so time is of the utmost importance. It may already be too late.\nWith deepest respect and hope for peace,\nVesna Tesla "
