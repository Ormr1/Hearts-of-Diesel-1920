EGY_A6_fr: "Secure The Keys"
EGY_A6_fr_desc: "In order to effectively challenge the occupying forces as equals, we need to be prepared. We need guns, money, and information, so seek them out."
EGY_A7: "For The Taking"
EGY_A7_desc: "It seems Roman operational security is quite lax. We have received word that an arms shipment is heading down the nile headed for the garrison troops at Thebes. Now, I don't know about you, but I think those guns would be better used by us. If we create a jam in the river in the middle of nowhere, we can hijack the shipment and grab it for ourselves miles away from Roman support."
EGY_A8: "Wrong Number"
EGY_A8_desc: "Thanks to some crossed wires, Imhotep has clued us into a rather juicy piece of gossip. Apparently, a senior Roman official in Alexandria is at risk of having his affair exposed unless he pays his mistress off to the tune of 5,000 solidus. Not wanting to cause a fuss, the powers that be in Constantinople are wiring him the money in a secure wireless transfer to keep things hush-hush. If we intercept the banking draft before it reaches him, we can pocket the change for our own ends and expose a selacious affair, undermining Roman reputations."
EGY_A9: "The Man On The Inside"
EGY_A9_desc: "A city councillor in Thebes has been campaigning for change in municipal policies for quite a while now, but has been getting nowhere as he's been blocked by the tetrachy at every turn, and they've set a whopping ambush for him in the next municipal election in the form of a nasty smear campaign. If we help him win the upcoming election, he says he'll be happy to pass on any information he gets to us and aid our troops in the struggle. Snub that smear, and put the fear of Osiris into his opponents."
EGY_A10: "Cheap And Simple"
EGY_A10_desc: "Making weapons cheaply and robustly is the key to winning, and we're going to need to evaluate designs. This seems like the perfect opportunity to hold an underground arms trial, with all the big anarchist names competing to get the contract."
EGY_A11_fr: "Ascend From Darkness"
EGY_A11_fr_desc: "Now we have prepared a small but dedicated force of guerillas, it is time to introduce ourselves to the opposition. Think of is as a friendly hello, that comes in the form of a fist from the shadows."
EGY_A12: "The Fight"
EGY_A12_desc: ""
EGY_A13: "Extra Extra"
EGY_A13_desc: "The Romans are eager to try and keep a lid on this whole thing. While they can’t solicit any foreign support this way, neither can we, and it certainly makes it harder to introduce our cause to the people. The Editorial staff of the Alexandrian Gazette are expected to meet with the Tetrarch’s staff later this week so the Romans can tell what they can and can’t print, and none of them are happy about it. I’m sure they’ll thank us if that meeting never happens."
EGY_A14: "Room Service"
EGY_A14_desc: "The Palm Plaza hotel in Cairo is a star in it’s own right. Every year, hundreds of the world’s elite flock there for their vacations. Movie stars, singers, diplomats, politicians, it’s a veritable who’s who in the lobby I swear. If we can set up a system of hidden microphones and recruit the staff , then we will be able to accrue enough blackmail material to last us a lifetime. Pharaoh Cleopatra’s Hollywood alter-ego might be useful for this."
EGY_A15: "Block-Busted"
EGY_A15_desc: "Marcus Lucius is known all over the world as a dashing silver-screen heart-throb, but we see him as a dastardly cad. As we speak, he has been cast by Bassileus Pictures as the lead in their new production of Anthony and Cleopatra. Obviously, being made by Romans with the need for propaganda, the script has had a few light historical changes. And by that we mean it’s a revisionist white-washing piece of trash, and what’s worse is that the bloody thing is being filmed in the temple of Ptah, in Memphis. Needless to say Mr Carter is incandescent with historical rage. Kidnap Lucius from the set and make sure that film dies on the cutting room floor."
EGY_A16_fr: "Rain Fire"
EGY_A16_fr_desc: "Our introduction seems to have made exactly the impression we wanted it to. As we speak, the Romans are taking measures to stop us. We should demonstrate that it is them who will be confounded, not us."
EGY_A17: "Fishrot"
EGY_A17_desc: "The Romans have managed to get some fun new toys for their security services to play with. Our watchers on the docks have noticed that the number of fishing boats in the Alexadrian bay and the Nile delta have tripled in the last month. Either the tetrachy is planning the mother of all seafood and sushi nights, or something is afoot. We believe that these boats are part of a cutting-edge network of hydrophones and signals monitoring systems intended to curb our arms shipments coming from Albion by sea. If this continues, the smugglers will balk and we'll have to bring them round the horn of Africa, majorly delaying delivery dates. Luckily, we have a solution: if we feed transponders wrapped in fish to the local dolphin population, we can effectively drown out any useful intelligence in a literal sea of white noise, turning their multi-million solidus surveillance system into a very expensive paperweight."
EGY_A18: "Bad Publicity"
EGY_A18_desc: ""
EGY_A19: "False Profits"
EGY_A19_desc: "A Byzantine consortium has slowly and with the tacit approval of the Tetrarchy been buying up resources production in Kemet, such as mines and food production. A fraction these products are returned to the people and when they are they're sold for high price, which would make the nile Byzantium's personal breadbasket. We would sabotage their flow of money, but nobody has figured out how they own 75% of this land's resources and still manage to make a loss. Until now. We believe that these profits are being siphoned back to Constantinople through the new cathedral in Alexandria, paid in as donations and then sent back to the head offices. Because it's religious money, it can't be taxed or levied, keeping it remarkably secure in transit. If we were to expose this, the Tetrarch would look like a fool and the combined scandal would be enough to drop their stock price through the floor."
EGY_A20: "It's The Pits"

EGY_A22: "The Good Doctor"
EGY_A22_desc: "At 2300 hours last night, we received an encoded transmission from Western Rome of all places. Turns out, one of Tesla's former scientists, who was forcibly recruited in the last war by the Romans, has had a change of heart and would like to offer us his services. Not that he needed much of a push, the nature of his recruitment was interesting to say the least. Having one of Tesla's all-stars on the team will be a significant technical advantage, and he is also promising current Roman research and diplomat cheques to the sum of 4,000 deben, recently lifted from the imperial treasury. The only problem is getting him out of there."
EGY_A23: "PSA"
EGY_A23_desc: "In a few weeks time, the Roman National Broadcasting Corporation is unveiling it's fancy new Aegyptus Local Network, allowing them to keep control of the narrative and a lid on the propaganda situation. We think that the people of Kemet would rather hear the voice of their Pharoah rallying them to fight for their heritage, history, and homeland. And with the brief window after switch-on when the repeaters are out of sync, we can hijack this network permanently and use it to our benefit."
EGY_A24: "Second Helpings"
EGY_A24_desc: "As things have rapidly gone tits-up, the Tetrarchy is trying to literally starve us and our supporters of supplies. Using the recent poor harvests in Anatolia as an excuse, they have instituted a new rationing system and have begun to co-opt food supplies for their own purposes. What isn't being tols is that the number and type of ration stamps you get depends on your job, where you live, and how loyal you are to the reigime of the day. If we raid the office of supply and currency, we can grab the printing plates being used and create perfect counterfeits of the ration books, distributing them to whoever we want to and permanently devaluing the system."
EGY_A25: "The Man From Pompeii"
EGY_A25_desc: "Neith weaves good fortune today. We have found out about a hand-over between Western Rome and the Byzantines taking place in the Alexandrian harbour. It seems that a Byzantine agent was picked up in Rome recently, and the powers that be have been negotiating to trade him for the elusive Man From Pompeii, a near-mythical spy that the Byzantines snagged by pure luck. If we interfere, we can make sure that Rome gets their boy back while the Byzantines get stiffed, handing the West their most valuable asset and breeding mutual distrust between the two nations."
EGY_A26_fr: "Skewer The Winged Beast"
EGY_A26_fr_desc: "Alarmingly, it seems that trouble is brewing over the Suez. As it would happen, the minority Muslim population in the area is being armed and radicalised by an outside party, we suspect the Saxons. Weaken this "Brotherhood" before it can even begin."
EGY_A27: "Denial"
EGY_A27_desc: "Whoever's backing the Muslims has inordinate amounts of global clout. They have recently arranged for the release of a radical scholar and preacher from Hispanian jail in order to rally them into a religious fervor. Of course, this man relies on his integrity to be convincing, so let's compromise that. Set him up in a hotel room with a hooker, two bottles of Irish Spirit, and a lot of Columbian marching powder, take a few photos, make some glossy 8x10s, and then send them global via the press, and it should critically injure his reputation enough for his people to reject him entirely."
EGY_A28: "Mine's A Big One"
EGY_A28_desc: "It's just as we feared: those sausage-scoffing blowhards in Saxony are funding the Muslim Brotherhood and supplying them with arms. They're doing it through the Trans-Aegean Shipping Corporation, a front for their smuggling but nonetheless effective. However, we have a plan to deal with this. If we fill oil-barrels with explosives and a contact fuse supplied by our friends in Albion, then we can make rudimentary sea mines. Chain those together and string them in front of the approaching ships from smaller boats, and we can scupper several very expensive shipments before they get wise."
EGY_A29: "De Pleur"
EGY_A29_desc: "Alarmingly, Jean 'De Pleur' Michel has been spotted by our agents in Suez, with the assumption that he is going to train Muslim troops in desert tactics that will be invaluable in their fight against us. De Pleur is very bad news. A Francian expert in desert warfare, he knows our terrain quite well, and his knowledge will remove any home advantage we ever had. Kidnap him, and make him see our way of thinking. Failing that, kill him."
EGY_A30: "Pulling The Rug"
EGY_A30_desc: "Seems like the Kaiser is doing a little bit of home decorating, and has gained an appreciation for the orient. He is willing to part with a sizable chunk of change in return for a priceless persian rug, which has fallen into the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine and Arabia. Assuredly, that chunk of change will be spent on weapons to fight us with, and we can't have that. The Kaiser is sending an appraiser to verify it's authenticity, and we have acquired with Mr Carter's expertise a very realistic looking fake that only a trained eye would be able to discern. Swap the rug for the fake, and it will certainly sour things between the Muslims and their benefactors, and we'll have a nice new rug for a museum. Or the Pharoah Cave."
EGY_A31_fr: "Wield A Fist Of Iron"
EGY_A31_fr_desc: "With our sights set firmly on Cairo, we will need some heavier equipment and greater forces before the final push. With the people rallied to the cry, recruitment isn't hard, but we'll need some showstopping new toys."
EGY_A32: "Prototype"
EGY_A32_desc: "The Eastern Roman empire has either developed or appropriated some cutting-edge mech technology, and are going to be testing it in the coming weeks. The 'Varangian' Assault Mech is their new fort-breaker model, designed with the sole purpose of assailing fortifications. And they're going to test it out by destroying the ruins of the great temple of bast at Karnakh. Other than this being a horrific afront to our gods, it is a direct assault on the patron goddess of the Pharoah Cleopatra, almost certainly intentional for propaganda purposes. We'd rather this didn't happen, and once in our hands the mech will be invaluable. Hijack the prototype, turn it loose on it's creators, and then return it to us."
EGY_A33: "Foreign Toys"
EGY_A33_desc: ""
EGY_A34: "The Motherlode"
EGY_A34_desc: "Imhotep's control of the local Roman broadcast network has already gotten results, in the form of some juicy new gossip that will soon be swimming it's way up the Red Sea. This is the big one, boys and girls, forget the big kahuna this kahuna is positively monumental in size. We estimate that this is the single largest covert arms shipment ever sent in the history of cloak-and-dagger. Destined for Arabia through the red sea, while disguised as a shipment of tractors, oil drilling equipment, and canned goods, it has a private security detail that rivals most Army Groups. Taking it will be no easy feat, but the commandos in the Sobek Battalion believe they have a plan..."
EGY_A35: "Decapitation"
EGY_A35_desc: "Things are swinging towards a nice strong crescendo, and if everything has gone to plan so far, we'll be ready to deliver the coup de grace. We need something big. Something bold. A real all-singing, all-dancing, showstopper of a performance to seal the deal. Even through all of this the Tetrarch has managed to keep his head. Let's change that. \n[IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'VE MISSED, NOW'S THE TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE THINGS GET REALLY WACKY FROM HERE ON OUT]"
EGY_A36_fr: "Raise Hell"
EGY_A36_fr_desc: "When we killed the Tetrarch, we effectively blew the starting whistle on a multi-faction rebellion free-for-all. No sooner than his corpse hit the floor, but the Muslims came crawling out of the suez aswell."
EGY_A37: "Vengeance"
EGY_A37_desc: "Abdul Al-Assid Said has been an evil little thorn in our side for too long, and his actions demand swift and mortifying retribution. The head of the Muslim Brotherhood's ersatz secret police-cum-intelligence service, he is responsible for the murder of some of our most loyal comrades, as well as the torture and execution of innocent civilians whose crimes range from aiding our cause to looking at him funny. This cannot and will not stand. The verdict is death, and the best way to go about it would be to cut him from anus to armpit and leave him gutted on the altar of sekhmet. I'm sure the goddess of war will appreciate the gift of her enemy's head on a silver platter."
EGY_A38: "The Colossus"
EGY_A38_desc: "Seems Doctor Meridius and the Varangian prototype mech are a match written in the stars. No sooner had we introduced the two of them, the good doctor had already laid bare the machines secrets for all to see, and has drawn up plans for a super-mech of our own. This is highly fortuitous, as concerning transmissions from Constantinople have suggested that they're planning on deploying a Centurion to aid in the defense of the administrative capital. For the uninitiated in the room, a Centurion is 50ft of steel and malice, used primarily to scare the enemy into surrendering. However, Doctor Meridius says he'll have an answer to that at the appropriate time, he just needs the parts."
EGY_A39: "Consul"
EGY_A39_desc: "With the Tetrarch disposed of, the Romans have stepped up their response to a full military engagement, and they're sending a military consul to take control of the situation. Legate Maximillian Horatius is the man best known for giving Western Rome a few very nasty kickings in their last war, and has been brought out of his retirement, which is bad news for us as his healthy measure of suspicion has made him nigh-untouchable in the past. Almost impossible to manipulate or assassinate, Roman resistance will be much stiffer with him in command. However, we have found a weak link close to the top of his chain of command: one of his lieutenants is a spy for Western Rome. If we reveal to him that his administration has been compromised and frame a few others, we can let his paranoia do the rest and the resulting witch-hunt will decimate the local officer's corps"
EGY_A40: "Damnation"
EGY_A40_desc: "The world weather office is predicting record rainfall this Akhet, meaning that the Nile will flood it's banks more than previously expected. The Romans are prepared for this, however, and have set up several lines of flood defenses around the capital and other vital areas. If we were to sabotage these, then these key areas would flood, hampering troop movement and causing mass electrical failure. Amphibious movement is our forte, and most of our troops have been paddling in flooded water most of their lives, so it gives us a distinct home advantage. What's more, one of our more bloody-minded commanders has had a brilliant if slightly evil idea: Force the Romans off structures and into the water with condensed artillery fire, then drop two cables connected to many large generators into the water, and you will effectively have turned downtown Cairo into a giant bug-zapper. The Municipal Power Plant 10Km outside the city limits should do the trick."
EGY_A41_fr: "Freedom"
EGY_A41_fr_desc: "'Step 9, Carter, Freedom!' \n'For you, Cleo! Not for me!' \n'CARTER!!!' "
EGY_A42: "The Final Push"
EGY_A42_desc: "Despite the cause of holding on to their 'Aegyptus' being a lost one, the forces of Byzantium are going to give us one final show of strength. They have amassed 70% of their southern army groups and are heading towards Suez at a breakneck pace. How they convinced the Saxons to let them walk through the levant is beyond us, but it may be the work of whoever had them backing those Muslims. No matter, the only concern now is the hoarde of angry Romans heading towards us."

EGY_Z.1.d: "July 1969, Polypicture Studios, Hollywood \nHerb Alvis' Office \nAh...Thebes. He hadn't been there in years. LA is hot, but the banks of the nile it ain't. As requested, he'd had the personal effects of one Howard Carter dug out of the archives. It was for this new 'Goddess Of The Nile' biopic. The studio was pulling out all the stops, and the star power was growing by the day, so they wanted accuracy and they'd pay to get it. Unfortunately, the authorities wouldn't let the package leave the country, so someone would have to go and get it in person. Lorelai will do fine. Might get her out of the bullpen. \nAlvis remembered the theme but not the details. Kemet in the 20's was a technicolour mess in a 40 degree heat. There was Cleo. Of course there was Cleo. And the bald one, who was...? And those jackass brothers, with the big santa-clause beards. And the one upstart from the south..."
EGY_Z.1.a: "Remember, Mr Alvis"



###EVENTS ALPHA###
EGY_AFOC.1.t: "He Came From Albion"
EGY_AFOC.1.d: "Our fledgling cause has found an unlikely ally. A few days ago, an esteemed professor of archaeology made contact with one of our agents, wishing to lend his support to our struggle. Seems he's gained quite the soft spot for the ancient times and wants to see them return as much as we do. \nRecruit Howard Carter."
EGY_AFOC.1.a: "Interesting. Does he come with his own pith helmet?"

EGY_A.2.t: "Pith-Helmet Included"
EGY_A.2.d: "Locating Mr Carter was easily done. We found him examining several astounding finds...that had already been discovered. In the Alexandrian Temple of Ma'at. Without permission. The high priest isn't happy about it, but he's willing to cut a deal considering it's the Pharaoh asking. He wants a small donation in return for Mr Carter."
EGY_A.2.a: "Alvis, pay the man"

EGY_A.3.t: "Sprung From The Crypt"
EGY_A.3.d: "Carter's in a rather cheery disposition considering he's spend the last 3 days in a temple basement. Kept himself occupied with the frescoes, he says. No matter, he's eager to help and willing to apply himself. And he's rather well connected too."
EGY_A.3.a: "Suits us fine"

EGY_AFOC.4.t: "Intelligence, Or Lack Thereof"
EGY_AFOC.4.d: "A signal-jacker was recently arrested in Cairo while trying to break encrypted Roman diplomatic telegrams, and is languishing in the city jail. His work can't be faulted, but his common sense leaves a lot to be desired: he left the door open while he was doing it and his landlady overheard him and ratted him out. Freeing him from his cell and recruiting him will be a boon to us and an effective two-finger salute to the Romans who put him there. \nRecruit Imhotep Astari."
EGY_AFOC.4.a: "A radio-ham. How drole..."

EGY_A.5.t: "Hamming It Up"
EGY_A.5.d: "Turns out springing him from the hoosgow was the easy part. The old-fashioned Cleopatra charm might have helped with the guards, but it was most likely the bribe money that did it. The hard part is getting his equipment back, which has been squirreled away by the Romans at some army holding depot. Now, we can make all sneaky-like and use some disguises, but we'll have to get them first. Or, we can ram-raid the gates like it's gangbusters and shoot the place up to a chorus of blaring alarms."
EGY_A.5.a: "See about getting those disguises"
EGY_A.5.b: "Shooting the place up sounds fun"

EGY_A.6.t: "Masters of Disguise"
EGY_A.6.d: "Grabbing some military uniforms required a bit of searching. Getting the right sizes was a tricky affair. The others fared fine, but have you tried finding a roman legionary with the build and height of a pint-sized Egyptian with an hourglass figure? Absolutely scandalous. Then there was the subject of getting the papers. We've no need for forgers here, the Tetrarch has unwittingly admitted a few of our own into his beurocracy, so it was just a matter of getting the papers written up."
EGY_A.6.a: "We've got his radios, that's all that matters"

EGY_A.7.t: "Strong Interference"
EGY_A.7.d: "As opposed to getting hold of military uniforms, this was remarkably simple. Drive in, shoot anything that moves, grab the equipment, and then run. Unfortunately, some of the radio kit must have made with the monkey business, because it was shot by a Roman soldier. Imhotep isn't pleased about it, but he has enough of the stuff left to get signals running, and he seems to be on board."
EGY_A.7.a: "Oh well, I suppose it worked out"

EGY_A.8.t: "We Begin Our Broadcast Day"

EGY_AFOC.9.a: "Tall, Dark, and Mysterious. I like it."

EGY_A.10.t: "Proving Legitimacy"
EGY_A.10.d: "The broker wants us to prove out legitimacy, so he's sent us on somewhat of a scavenger hunt. What he wants is a very specific diplomatic communique form, only issued by the Frankish embassies of the world. Now, there isn't a Frankish Embassy in Kemet. Their embassy to Byzantium is in Constantinople. However, and I believe this is the test, there is one passing through Alexandria by way of a courier in a few weeks time. If we snag that paper and deliver it to the broker, he's confident he can connect us to all the weapons and supplies we need. All we have to do is find where the courier is handing the papers off."
EGY_A.10.a: ""

EGY_A.11.t: "The Twist"
EGY_A.11.d: "Seems like there's a fortuitous twist to the tale: the courier is corrupt. He isn't handing the diplomatic papers to the Frankish contact, he's handing them to a Western Roman agent known as Cabrillius. We've had tabs on Cabrillius for a good while now, and we know nobody's coming to pick that up for a while, but we don't have all the time in the world. The Frankish have also been keeping tabs on him, and they're close to getting him. We have several options on how to get our hands on those papers before they do. Firstly, the conventional approach: break into his apartment, kill Cabrillius, and take the papers. Secondly, his mistress is a friend of one of the priestesses of the goddess Isis, a part of the clergy that strongly supports our cause. We can use our connection there to have her steal the papers. Thirdly, and the especially difficult option, we can have one of our operatives pose as Cabrillius'contact and literally have him hand us what we want. Either way, we'll have the papers before the Franks or the Romans do."

EGY_A.12.d: "I would say there are many ways to skin a cat, but you're looking at me like you want to kill me so I won't...say...that...thing. I'll just get to the point, shall I? There are two main entrypoints. We can bribe the apartment superintendent to allow us to enter through the service bay and use the freight elevator to get up to his apartment. Then, we can use the garbage chute to move his body, effectively making him disappear. Or, we can go in through the front, take the main elevator up, and leave the body for the autoritites to find."
EGY_A.12.a: "Bribing the Superintendent Seems Best"
EGY_A.12.b: "I Thought This Was Minimal Fuss"

EGY_A.13.t: "Minimal Fuss P2"

It appears to be a typewriter that can type by itself based on radio signals it recieves. A curiosity, we believe that this is how his Western Roman handlers kept in contact with him. The device has been handed over to Imhotep for study, and the broker has been notified that we have the documents."

EGY_A.16.t: "The Mistress P1"
EGY_A.16.d: "We've located Cabrillius' mistress, a young woman named Nebit, who is unfortunately unable to assist as she is in a spot of bother. It appears that Nebit is also a prostitute. Now, prostitution is a cultural profession as old as Kemet itself, an the pharaoh doesn't judge, but what we don't like is pimps. And this pimp is getting more and more controlling by the day. Now, we have two approaches to this. Firstly, for once we have a common enemy with the Romans, so we can grass him in to the local police force and have him arrested. Or, we can get straight to the point and shoot him directly in his head."

In any case, the pimp was picked up last night by the Alexandrian City Police, and is currently looking at 5 to 10 in jail for posession of illicit substances and labour practices. Nebit is thrilled with the result, and says she can pick the documents up the next time she visits Cabrillius."

EGY_A.19.d: "We've had a note left by the High Priestess of the Temple of Isis, giving us a hearty congratulations for the work in assisting a friend of the clergy. This will do wonders for our reputation with the religious officials, and will certainly open doors for us in the future. The broker has been notified that we have his documents, and is expected to call within the hour."
EGY_A.19.a: "Excellent Work"

EGY_A.20.t: "Living Dangerously P1"
EGY_A.20.d: "This is the difficult one, gentlemen. To make this happen is going to take guile, determination, and some expert forgery. Cabrillius' handlers identify themselves with the spade lapel pin, the membership badge of the Black Spade Club. Secondly, they're expecting a Roman, not a Kemetite. So, we have to forge a very unique and intricate pin, and find ourselves a willing Roman participant. And we need to keep the meeting place covered by a sniper with more muscle in the wings if things go bad. No pressure."
EGY_A.20.a: "What's the matter, I thought you liked a challenge."

EGY_A.21.t: "Living Dangerously P2"
EGY_A.21.d: "This plan is wrinklier than a prune's grandmother in the midday sun. First of all, we managed to pick up a Roman who will play the part...as long as we don't hand him into the police. Turns out he's wanted for armed robbery and there's a warrant out for his arrest, so he can't be seen in public. Secondly, we cannot seem to replicate the pin to perfect detail, but we have a good enough copy, which will have to fool the bouncers of the club because thirdly, Cabrillius has changed the meeting place to the Black Spade Club itself. Oh, and the sniper can't make it, his mother's sick. So we have two options: try and walk our man in through the front and hope the bouncer doesn't notice the bad fake pin, or sneak him in dressed as a waiter."

EGY_A.22.t: "Living Dangerously P3"
EGY_A.22.d: "Sneaking him in as a waiter has been more difficult than expected. Seems that the staff are under as much scrutiny as the guests. However, with some quick talking, he has been able to shake most suspicion."

EGY_A.23.d: "walking in through the front was not a popular choice, but we've had a stroke of luck: the man working the door is new, an doesn't quite know what the pins should look like yet. Needless to say, our guy walked in without any real problems."

EGY_A.24.d: "Wrinkle number four: Frankish agents working with the local police are storming the club with sights firmly on Cabrillius and our man. Our henchmen, posing as members of the criminal underclass, are returning fire but Cabrillius has died for his country. Our man has slipped out the back door in the confusion and has managed to escape with the documents, but would like it to be noted that Mission Impossible wasn't his favourite radio-drama. Still, it could be worse. It could have been our club being shot up."

EGY_AFOC.26.t: "The Producer"
EGY_AFOC.26.d: "Cleopatra's time in hollywood has put her in contact with a lot of men who can turn logistical nightmares into cakewalks. One of these men is Herbert Alvis, a big-shot Hollywood producer who has hit a losing streak after backing the wrong horse. Apparently 'French Mistake' is slang for something else and not suitable for film title. Regardless of his taste in creative direction, he's impressively skilled at getting things organised and schmoozing rich people out of their money. This means that he is a very busy man, but we think we've got a few decent ideas as to how to get his attention. You see, despite the screw up with 'The French Mistake', Alvis has returned to strength as a creative lead with his new thrilling adventure 'Escape From Castle Wulvenreich'. It's a smash hit, and critics across the globe are giving it 5 stars. Jack Thomas, a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press, is writing his review from Cairo. If we were to make a less than favourable review of our own and submit it in his place, it would be sure to get Alvis' attention. Alternatively, we can lure him here with his former long-time colleague, Cleo LaFay. Ring any bells?  \nRecruit Herbert Alvis."
EGY_AFOC.26.a: "The Review Idea Seems Fun"
EGY_AFOC.26.b: "I Don't Know What You're Talking About..."

EGY_A.27.t: "Everyone's A Critic P1"
EGY_A.27.d: "...'Escape From Castle Wulvenreich was supposed to be Herbert Alvis' redemption, but it seems like he's retreated into the cozy and yet over-played bosom of Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker, with just enough modernity thrown in to give creedance and relevance to the tale. You'd think a monster movie would be easily written, and yet we cannot relate to the baron of the titular castle, let alone the plights of the heroes. The film is over-acted, overcooked, and certainly over-stays it's welcome, and I for one am not so much enthralled by Hollywood hams in fake teeth and bad makeup chasing buxom starlets around cardboard sets. 1 out of 5 stars.'..."
EGY_A.27.a: "Oh, that's diabolical..."

EGY_A.28.t: "Everyone's A Critic P2"
EGY_A.28.d: "Our changes to the review have had the exact effect we were hoping for. No sooner than the paper had hit the stands, Mr Alvis came screaming halfway around the world on express airship looking for the person responsible for panning his magnum opus. Within days he has burst into Cairo, and is on a cultural rampage across the city going from printer to journalist to find the ungrateful bastard who dared to give him less than 3 stars. It will only be a matter of time before he comes looking for us."
